Explaining icons and their usage

Testing github as an option for hosting this project. 


The idea behind the project is to have a repo of _all_ icons with logs of the names they go buy and explanation of (common) usage, which should help upcoming (and established) designers when it comes to deciding whether or not the icon they're looking up is a good choice for their usecase. As creating this would require a lot of time and extensive knowledge of iconography, pictography ad symbolism in different cultures, to keep it a reliable source, building it requires involvement of many people with different backgrounds. Therefore, it makes sense to open source it.

As I believe that prior to packing this up pretty, it would need to exist first, I've the idea of creating a spreadsheet with appropriate columns that can be filled in per icon first. Then, if this project gets 'enough' data to validate working it into a full blown website/directory, it shall be so. Until then, a spreadsheet! :D
